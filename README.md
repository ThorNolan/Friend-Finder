Existential Friend Finder
=======================================================================
Do we ever really connect with one another? Is it possible to know another human being, or are we limited only to our own dilluted representations of what other people must think and feel and experience? Are we all doomed to inescapable loneliness? This full-stack application was designed to provide users with just a moment of relief, which will come when they are matched with whoever responds to the survey most similarly to them, even though it will be snuffed out like a light the moment they dismiss the modal popup displaying their perfect match. 

## How to use the app: 
+ Users are asked to provide their name and a link to a photo, and then fill out a short survey consisting of 10 existential statements. 
  
+ Users can respond to each statement by selecting a number on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is strongly disagree, 3 is neutral, and 5 is strongly agree. 
  
+ Upon submitting the survey, users will be matched with the person who has answered the survey questions most similarly to them, and shown their name and picture. It relies on express and path for routing and node for its server environment.
